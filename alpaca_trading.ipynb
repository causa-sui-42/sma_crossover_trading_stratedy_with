First, we import the alpaca_trade_api module, which provides access to the Alpaca Python SDK. \n","2.   We create an instance of the Alpaca API by passing in our API key ID, secret key, and API version. This instance will be used to authenticate our connection to the Alpaca data streaming service.\n","3. We define the symbol that we want to stream data for. In this example, we are using the ticker symbol for Apple (AAPL).\n","4. We create a new instance of the StreamConn class, which connects to the Alpaca data streaming service using our API key ID and secret key.\n","\n","5. We define a function called handle_bar that will be called whenever a new bar update is received for the specified symbol. The `@stream.on_bar(symbol)` decorator tells the Alpaca SDK to call this function whenever a new bar update is received for the specified symbol.\n","\n","6. Inside the handle_bar function, we simply print the bar update to the console.\n","\n","7. Finally, we start the data streaming service by calling `stream.run(['trade_updates', f'{symbol}_bars'])`. The run method takes a list of channels to subscribe to, which in this case includes the trade_updates channel and the AAPL_bars channel.\n","\n","Once you run this code, you should start seeing real-time updates for Apple's bars printed to the console. You can modify this code to stream data for other symbols and to perform more advanced analysis and trading based on the real-time data updates."],"metadata":{"id":"SVaJlemFMy8L"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Scheduling the script with AWS Lambda"],"metadata":{"id":"AAFFuH_LNYIa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To schedule this script to run in AWS Lambda, you can create a Lambda function with the Python runtime and copy the code into the Lambda function.
